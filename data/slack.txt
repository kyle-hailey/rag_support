### Topic: OAuth Integration Blocking Feature ABC-123

[10:32 AM] alice:
Hey, just a heads up — the deployment failed last night. Looks like we're missing the `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` env var on staging.

[10:34 AM] bob:
Yeah, I noticed that too. I think it’s related to the new login flow we merged.

[10:36 AM] alice:
Could be. Also, Jira ticket ABC-123 is blocked until this is fixed.

[10:38 AM] carol:
Just talked to the auth team. They’re still waiting on a security review before they can finalize the config.

[10:40 AM] bob:
Ugh. So we’re bottlenecked on that. Anyone know when the review is happening?

[10:42 AM] carol:
Tentatively tomorrow. I’ll ping them again and update the ticket.

[10:45 AM] alice:
Thanks. Just noting it here so we have a paper trail in case the client follows up.

### Summary:
Feature ABC-123 is blocked due to a missing OAuth environment variable and an unresolved security review on the login flow. The auth team is the current dependency.
