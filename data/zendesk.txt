### Source: Zendesk
### Ticket ID: #789
### Subject: SSO Login Failing for Enterprise Users
### Created: 2024-05-12
### Status: Escalated to Engineering
### Customer: Acme Corp

#### Description:
Customer reports that SSO login redirects them to a blank page after authentication.

#### Customer Comments:
- [2024-05-12, John from Acme]:
  > After logging in via Microsoft SSO, our users are redirected to a blank screen. We see no errors client-side, but users are unable to access their dashboard.

#### Internal Comments:
- [Support Agent: Lila, 2024-05-12]:
  > Possible issue with redirect URI or session cookie. Forwarding to engineering.

- [Alice W., Engineering, 2024-05-13]:
  > Looks related to recent changes in OAuth callback handler (see PR #456). The redirect URI might not be whitelisted for Acme’s tenant.

#### Resolution Plan:
Hold until PR #456 is merged and deployed. Ensure `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` includes Acme’s enterprise domain.
